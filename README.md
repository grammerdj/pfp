This Github repo holds all of the code for my personal financial planning webapp that I am working on.

Webapp Components:

1) Relational DB - holds participant information that has been entered or generated by the webapp
2) Document DB - holds configuration JSONs for tax structures, account structures, asset class configurations, and macroeconomic/demographic configurations
3) Python-based Simulator - discounts all participant information back to the present, and simulates the optimal portfolio makeup under different risk tolerances and configuration RVs to obtain asset allocations
4) Website - provides an interface to enter financial snapshot information and get simulation results
